About the Computer Programs

There are four groups of computer programs discussed in this book.
These are

• The data analysis library in the form of the package datan,
• The graphics library in the form of the package datangraphics,
• A collection of example programs in the package examples,
• Solutions to the programming problems in the package solutions. 

The programs of all groups are available both as compiled classes and
(except for datangraphics.DatanGraphics) also as source files.
In addition there is the extensive Java-typical documentation in html format.

Every class and method of the package datan deals with a particular, well defined problem,
which is extensively described in the text. That also
holds for the graphics library, which allows to produce practically
any type of line graphics in two dimensions. For many purposes it suffices,
however, to use one of 5 classes each yielding a complete graphics.
